<h1>Example of Transitive JS code inclusion</h1>

This page shows how an HTML page can include and use a high level class without
having to also include all its lower level dependencies.
<p/>

Loading this page should produce two console messages with the following texts:
<ul>
    <li>Hello from **HIGH** level component</li>
    <li>Hello from **LOW** level component</li>
</ul>
<p/>
If it does not, it means the include did not work.

<script type="module">
    // Note: HighLevelComponent depends on LowLevelComponent, but the HTML
    // page does not have to include it directly. It will be included by
    // HighLevelComponent
    //
    import {HighLevelComponent} from "./HighLevelComponent.js";
    const highLev = new HighLevelComponent();
    // This HighLevelComponent method does not depend on LowLevelComponent
    highLev.hello();

    // But this method delegates to LowLevelComponent
    highLev.helloLow();
</script>
